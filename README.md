# 🌀 VibeChan

> _Chana is dead, long live VibeChan!_ _(new logo is ai generated btw)_

**VibeChan** is a reimagining of [**Chana**](https://apkpure.com/chana-superior-4chan-reader/com.basedorg.chana), the beloved imageboard viewer app — now reborn through pure chaotic creativity, AI hallucinations, and ✨vibes✨.

This is not just a rewrite. This is a **vibecoded resurrection**. We're building the new version using only AI tools, in a flow we call **vibecoding**.

## 🌈 What's VibeChan?

A collaborative weekend-ish project where the only goal is to create *something fun*, powered entirely by AI-generated code. You don’t have to understand what the code does. You don’t even have to write it.

You just:
- See stuff  
- Say stuff  
- Run stuff  
- Copy/paste stuff  

LLMs do the rest.

## 📖 A Brief History

- 🪦 **Chana**: A comfy imageboard viewer app. Sleek. Loved. Coded by hand.  
- 🌀 **VibeChan**: A full-on AI-coded reincarnation. Dripping in vibes. Guided by hallucinations and half-baked ideas spoken into SuperWhisper.

## 🧠 What Is Vibecoding?

> There's a new kind of coding I call "vibe coding", where you fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists...  
> I just see stuff, say stuff, run stuff, and copy paste stuff, and it mostly works.

– *A certified Vibecoder*

In short:  
🗣️ You talk to LLMs.  
🧠 You don’t read diffs.  
🪄 You accept everything.  
💥 You prompt until bugs disappear.

It’s coding, without the coding. And it’s amazing.

## 🚫 Rules of the Repo

**NO human-authored code.**  
You must use LLMs to contribute. Always.

You can use:
- Cursor + Composer  
- Copilot  
- ChatGPT / Claude / Gemini  
- Whisper + Voice  
- Or anything else that writes code for you  

Just don't manually write logic. That’s illegal here.
